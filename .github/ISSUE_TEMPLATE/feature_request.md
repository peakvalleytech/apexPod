Make sure you are using the latest version of AntennaPod. Perhaps the feature you are looking for has already been implemented.

Use the search function to see if someone else has already submitted the same feature request. If there is another request already, please upvote the first post instead of commenting something like "I also want this".

To make it easier for us to keep track of requests, please only make one feature request per issue.

Give a brief explanation about the problem that may currently exist and how your requested feature solves this problem.

Try to be as specific as possible. Please not only explain what the feature does, but also how. If your request is about (or includes) changing or extending the UI, describe what the UI would look like and how the user would interact with it.
